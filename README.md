## Synopsis

Snap-indent provides simple automatic indentation (and optional formatting) when yanking/pasting text. It was inspired by [auto-indent-mode](https://github.com/mattfidler/auto-indent-mode.el), and is designed for improved simplicity, flexibility, and interoperability.

`snap-indent-mode` is an Emacs minor mode that enables the following features:

- Indent inserted text according to major mode on yank/paste
- Indent buffer text according to major mode on save (optional)
- When indenting, additionally format text, e.g. tabify, untabify, remove trailing whitespace, etc (optional)
- Prevent minor mode activation in certain major modes (optional)

Snap-indent's additional formatting behavior is very flexible. Any function that operates on a region may be used, and multiple functions may be specified.

## Related packages

### Complement to electric-indent-mode

`electric-indent-mode` indents while typing. Snap-indent indents on yank/paste and optionally on save. These do not overlap, and work well together.

### Replacement for auto-indent-mode

Snap-indent was created as a minimalist replacement for `auto-indent-mode`. That package is surprisingly complex, and while I respect the ambition of its author, complexity has costs. At the time snap-indent was created, `auto-indent-mode` had numerous interoperability bugs with other common packages. Its approach hadn't aged well.

In contrast, snap-indent, while quite flexible, is designed for simplicity and hygiene. It doesn't overwrite built-in functionality or use function advice. It's lightweight and should play well with other packages. And it has unit tests.

## Installation

Snap-indent is available from [MELPA](https://melpa.org/). 

## Usage

Execute `M-x snap-indent-mode` to enable in any buffer, or add a hook to enable for a specific mode:

```elisp
(add-hook prog-mode-hook #'snap-indent-mode)
```

To configure via `use-package`, adapt the following example as desired:

```elisp
(use-package snap-indent
  :hook (prog-mode . snap-indent-mode)
  :custom ((snap-indent-format 'untabify)
           (snap-indent-on-save t)))
```

### Additional formatting

Snap-indent can optionally apply additional formatting when indenting. This is highly customizable and controlled by the variable `snap-indent-format`. When non-nil, this variable may be either a single function or a list of functions to apply sequentially:

```elisp
(setq snap-indent-format 'untabify)                                  ; single function
(setq snap-indent-format '(untabify delete-trailing-whitespace ...)) ; list of functions
```

Each function must accept two arguments: the beginning and end positions of the region on which to operate. Functions may be specified as symbols or lambda forms.
