;;; Commentary:

;; Snap-indent provides simple automatic indentation (and optional formatting)
;; when yanking/pasting text. It was inspired by `auto-indent-mode', and is
;; designed for improved simplicity, flexibility, and interoperability.
;;
;; `snap-indent-mode' is an Emacs minor mode that enables the following
;; features:
;;
;; - Indent inserted text according to major mode on yank/paste
;; - Indent buffer text according to major mode on save (optional)
;; - When indenting, additionally format text, e.g. tabify, untabify, remove
;;   trailing whitespace, etc (optional)
;; - Prevent minor mode activation in certain major modes (optional)
;;
;; Snap-indent's additional formatting behavior is very flexible. Any function
;; that operates on a region may be used, and multiple functions may be
;; specified.
